# Final Project

For my Internet and Web Technologies class. 

Utilizes 2 APIs *(SeatGeek and WeatherStack)* synchronously and HTTP and HTTPS protocols on Node.js.

# Guidelines

1. End user visits home page, where server sends a form to complete

2. End user submits form, and server uses captured data to send first API request

3. When first API request response is received, server parses response and generates request to second API

4. When second API request response is received, server parses response and end user receives results.
